Hello everyone, I am @yzdanh. I will officially be an undergraduate student studying computer science in september 2023. 
I am currently teaching myself Python, GIT / GIThub, discrete mathematics, Linear Algebra and other essensial concepts / skills that I will need in my journey towards becoming a software enginner
This GIThub account was created with the intention of learning GIT / GIThub and Python simoultaniously. I plan on placing my future projects onto this account so stay tuned!
